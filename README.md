# EquipColor v1.01

An addon for World of Warcraft version 1.12 that colors unusable items red in the inventory and the bank. 
It also colors known recipes green in the inventory and the bank.

It can work with the default bags UI or with the following addons:
Bagnon, Banknon, AllInOneInventory, EngInventory and SUCC-bag. Although SUCC-bag has a small bug as of now.
